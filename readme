Lovely collaboration in this group of students.

pick_a_number.py is the Normal Mode homework assignment. It includes the optional part.

stumping_the_computer.py is the Hard Mode of the assignment.

helping_computer_guess.py is the Very Hard Mode. it only goes a little ways
toward making the computer smarter. i think i could probably figure out how to
capture the "oh, you got close" guess and control the min and max. i had a version
that would do that, but it reset everytime the guess was close, which seemed
to actually make it harder.
